I'm a Ph.D. student in Linguistics at the University of Fribourg (Switzerland). My research interests lie at the intersection of **lexical semantics**, **derivational morphology** and **quantitative analysis**.

**Current projects**
* Ambiguity in derivation
* Semantic transparency in word formation
* Affix rivalry
* Affix polyfunctionality
